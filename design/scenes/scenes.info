These are meant to help layout scene, I say "meant to" because I'm lazy about updating them when I change a scene.

Most of these were copied and pasted from Retail Clerk '89 and were outdated even then. 

Some have been updated to reflect the current layout while others are still outdated.

I'll try to do better if there's a Retail Clerk '91.
