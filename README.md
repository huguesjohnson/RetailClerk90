# Retail Clerk '90
A work in-progress casual adventure game for the Sega Genesis written in 68000 assembly. 

This is a sequel to Retail Clerk '89. Since it's possible nobody played that, Retail Clerk '90 is an independent story. Playing the first game wouldn't hurt though.

The main goal of this is to improve on the engine and tooling developed for Retail Clerk '89. I have this ill-conceived idea for a set of tools to build adventure-like games for classic game consoles. If I accidentally produce an OK game along the way I guess that's nice. The Genesis is the first console I'm trying this idea on because.. well, I don't recall why I chose it.

The rough list of planed enhancements from Retail Clerk '89 -> '90 includes:

* Auto-generate anything that can reasonably be auto-generated
* Adding fast travel on the map
* Simplify interactions with items and NPCs - this will make the game less-annoying and also allow for 2-button systems to be supported later
* Make scene change events part of action table (this probably sounds like gibberish to anyone that's not me)
