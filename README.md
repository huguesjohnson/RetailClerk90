# Retail Clerk '90
A work in-progress casual adventure game for the Sega Genesis written in 68000 assembly. 

This is a sequel to Retail Clerk '89. Since it's possible nobody played that, Retail Clerk '90 is an independent story. Playing the first part wouldn't hurt though.

The main goal of this is to improve on the engine and tooling developed for Retail Clerk '89. The rough list of planed enhancements includes:

* Auto-generate anything that can reasonably be auto-generated
* Adding fast travel on the map
