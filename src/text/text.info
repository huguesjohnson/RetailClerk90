There's a 0.000001% chance this will ever be translated to another language.
(Almost) All the game text is in one folder to make it easier if that happens.

The best way to go about it is:
1) Copy the /en-us/ folder and rename to your preferred region+language combo
2) Painfully change all the text
3) Not rename any of the labels
4) Also leave the table_whatever files in the /text/ root alone
5) Change the include paths in the main file
6) Change version in init_Header to avoid confusion
7) NPC names need to be updated in the build file
8) Rebuild

Things that will make translations difficult:
1) In the overhead view, the dialog displays a fixed 22 chars per row
2) Game font only includes ASCII, unused chars could be re-purposed though
3) The game logo text is not in this file
4) Character & item names are also restricted to small values
5) Character names are set through build scripts, so they can be manually
changed but that risks them being overridden if a full build is run

The second item is the one I feel worst about..
It makes adding non-English characters a complete nightmare.
Another option would be extending the dialog font but that has issues too..
Hint: If you try doing that you may have to update the DIALOG_BASE_TILE constant.

If someone does translate this into a different language I will gladly post it.

Yes, all the English text in this demo was written by a native English speaker.
I know that is very difficult to believe.
