There's a 0.000001% chance this will ever be translated to another language.
(Almost) All the game text is in one folder to make it easier if that happens.

The best way to go about it is:
1) Copy the design/text/en-us/ folder and rename to your preferred region+language combo
2) Painfully change all the text in the json files
3) Not rename any of the labels
4) Change the paths in the build file
5) Change version in header (also in the build file) to avoid confusion
6) Rebuild

Things that will make translations difficult:
1) In the overhead view, the dialog displays a fixed 22 chars per row
2) Game font only includes ASCII, unused chars could be re-purposed though
3) The game logo text is not in this file
4) Character & item names are also restricted to small values
5) Right to left text rendering would be a code change (likely not complicated)

The second item is the one I feel worst about..
It makes adding non-English characters a complete nightmare.
Another option would be extending the dialog font but that has issues too..
Hint: If you try doing that you may have to update the DIALOG_BASE_TILE constant.

If someone does translate this into a different language I will gladly post it.

Yes, all the English text in this demo was written by a native English speaker.
I know that is very difficult to believe.
