Summary
********************************************************************************
The license summary for this project is:
* MIT License for original source code
* CC BY-SA 4.0 for original characters, story, art, & other non-code things
* 3rd party assets (code, graphics, music) are under their respective licenses

The intent behind this is:
* The game code is under a permissive license & can be reused with no drama
  * For example - using any portion of this code to build a different game
* Most of the graphics are based on (inexpensive) licensed tilesets
  * They can not be used in derivative works without buying a license   
* Anything reusing the scenario (characters, settings, story) is CC BY-SA 4.0
  * For example - creating a sequel or spin-off
  * Another example - porting this demo as-is to a different system
  * I understand it's extremely unlikely anyone would ever want to do these

I can't stop anyone from making physical reproductions of this game but would
really prefer they didn't. This is a free game and I'd like to keep it that way.
