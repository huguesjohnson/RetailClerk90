The easiest way to link to this code is:
1) Copy to {project-src}/lib/retailclerk/
3) Add: include 'lib/retailclerk/inc_RetailClerk.X68'
3) Make sure your project includes the Retail Clerk memory map and other constants (or is generating them via the Retail Clerk build tools)
4) If you think there's something you don't need comment out the include line(s) in inc_RetailClerk.X68
